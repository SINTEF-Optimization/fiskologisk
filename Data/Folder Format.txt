Folder name format:
	[S_]M<m>_T<t>_Y<y>_E<e>_P<p>
where
	m = # modules
	t = # tanks in each modules
	y = # years in main planning horizon
	e = # periods in extended planning horizon
	p = # periods in preplanning horizon
	S_  when present means the setup is based on using modules with only one production cycle, and then using program input to limit the number of active simultaneous module production cycles.

Input parameters under "periods" should hold

	planning_periods = 12 * y + e
	pre_planning_periods = p
	latest_deploy = (number of months in planning horizon before latest deploy month) + p
