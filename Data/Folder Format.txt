Folder name format:
	[S_]M<m>_T<t>_Y<y>_E<e>_P<p>[_F]
where
	m = # modules
	t = # tanks in each modules
	y = # years in main planning horizon
	e = # periods in extended planning horizon
	p = # periods in preplanning horizon
	S_  when present means the setup is based on using modules with only one production cycle, and then using program input to limit the number of active simultaneous module production cycles.
	_F  when present means the setup has input files for fixed startup of production cycles

Input parameters under "periods" should hold

	planning_periods = 12 * y + e
	pre_planning_periods = p
	latest_deploy = (number of months in planning horizon before latest deploy month) + p
